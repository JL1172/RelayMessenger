# End-to-End Encrypted Terminal-Based Messenger

## Project Description

This project is a hobby end-to-end encryption terminal-based messenger. It utilizes a WebSocket server as a relay for client-side encrypted messages. The encryption process is a symmetric key process that utilizes a set of RSA keys. This messenger ensures that messages remain private and secure between users, leveraging robust encryption methodologies.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Server runtime environment.
- **WebSocket Library**: For establishing and handling WebSocket connections.
- **readline-sync**: For handling terminal prompts.
- **chalk**: For styling terminal output.
- **Multiple Modules**: Various Node.js modules to support encryption and utility functions.

## Features

- End-to-end encryption of messages.
- Secure WebSocket-based communication.
- User-friendly terminal interface.
- Symmetric key encryption with RSA key exchange.

## How to Use
